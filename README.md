## About


This repository contains the decrypted and decompressed contents of the `eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz` file released by "The Shadow Brokers". The contents are supposedly a free sample of the files exfiltrated from the [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group), a notorious, highly-sophisticated cyber attack group.

The Shadow Brokers have opened an auction to sell off the remaining files, although the legitimacy of the auction is widely disputed. See the original auction announcement here: https://theshadowbrokers.tumblr.com/post/148871184165/equation-group-cyber-weapons-auction

Only files in the [`Firewall`](Firewall) directory are from the archive. [`listing.txt`](listing.txt) shows a list of all the files in the original archive, along with their file date and timestamps.

## Disclaimers

This repository is provided as an educational resource to researchers wanting to validate the claims of the Shadow Brokers, as well as anyone wanting to study code potentially originating from a powerful threat actor. Needless to say, this repository may contain extremely malicious code, and I (@nneonneo) disclaim any responsibility for what may happen with your use or misuse of this software.

The code does *not* belong to me, but the author of the code is unknown and is very unlikely to step up to enforce any copyright claims. Nevertheless, if takedown is warranted I will gladly remove the repository.


free-file的文件主要涉及的内容是针对防火墙的扫描器、漏洞利用框架等等:
BLATSTING -- 穷举爆破
EXPLOITS -- 漏洞利用代码
OPS -- 攻击操作控制工具包
SCRIPTS -- 脚本资源引用库
TOOLS -- 辅助工具包(编码转换、IP格式转换、加密解密装换等等)
